                     GROUND CONTROL STATION ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. System Overview

The Ground Control Station (GCS) is responsible for receiving and displaying 
real-time telemetry data transmitted from the UAV. The GCS architecture is 
divided into two subsystems: Ground Hardware Acquisition and Ground Control 
Software (Visualization).

The Ground Hardware Acquisition subsystem captures the 2.4GHz wireless telemetry 
signal from the air unit using an nRF24L01+ receiver module. This RF module 
communicates with an ESP8266 microcontroller via the SPI protocol. The ESP8266 
acts as a bridge between the RF link and the computer, converting received data 
packets into JSON format and transmitting them over USB serial at 115200 baud. 
The entire ground hardware unit is powered through USB, with the ESP8266 
supplying 5V to the nRF module through its VIN pin.

The Ground Control Software runs in a web browser and connects directly to the 
ESP8266 using the Web Serial API. This eliminates the need for any backend 
server, making the system completely standalone. The software displays live 
GPS coordinates, altitude, speed, and other flight parameters on an interactive 
map interface.


B. Selection of ESP8266 for Ground Receiver

Choosing the right microcontroller for the ground receiver was an important 
design decision. The ground receiver needs to receive RF data and send it to 
the computer. We evaluated several options before selecting the ESP8266.

We first considered the Arduino Uno and Nano, which use the ATmega328P chip. 
These boards are very popular and easy to program. However, they have only 2KB 
of RAM, which is not enough for our application. When receiving RF packets and 
converting them to JSON format, the memory usage can exceed 1.5KB. This leaves 
almost no room for the program to run properly, causing instability and crashes. 
Additionally, Arduino Uno and Nano do not have any wireless connectivity 
built-in, so they can only work with external RF modules. Therefore, these 
boards were not suitable for this project.

Next, we looked at STM32-based boards like the Blue Pill and Black Pill. These 
use the STM32F103 chip with a 72MHz ARM processor and 20KB RAM, which is more 
than enough for our needs. However, programming these boards requires additional 
hardware like an ST-LINK programmer. The Arduino library support for STM32 is 
also not as mature as other platforms, and there are fewer examples available 
for interfacing with the nRF24L01+ module. Like Arduino, STM32 boards also lack 
built-in wireless connectivity. For a final year project with limited time, 
this added complexity was not practical.

The main reason we selected the ESP8266 is its built-in WiFi capability. While 
our current implementation uses the nRF24L01+ module for the RF link between 
the UAV and ground station, the ESP8266's WiFi feature provides an important 
advantage for future development. If we want to eliminate the nRF module in 
future versions, we can configure the system to use WiFi communication instead. 
The ESP32 on the UAV (which is the primary flight controller) also has WiFi 
capability, so both ends can communicate directly over WiFi without needing 
any external RF modules.

In the current version, we are using nRF24L01+ for the wireless link because:
- It provides a dedicated point-to-point RF connection
- It has lower latency compared to WiFi
- It works in areas where there is no WiFi network available
- It is simple to implement and well-documented

However, having WiFi on the ground receiver means we have flexibility for the 
future. We can switch to WiFi-based telemetry when operating in areas with 
existing WiFi infrastructure or when integration with other network-connected 
devices is required.

Apart from WiFi, the ESP8266 also meets our basic requirements. It runs at 
80MHz and has 80KB of usable RAM, which is sufficient for JSON processing. It 
comes with an onboard USB-UART chip (CH340 or CP2102), so it can connect 
directly to the computer without any extra components. The Arduino core for 
ESP8266 is well-developed, and libraries like ArduinoJson work reliably on 
this platform.

It is important to clarify that the ESP32 is used as the main MCU on the UAV 
itself, where it handles GPS parsing, sensor reading, and telemetry 
transmission. The ESP32 was chosen for the air segment because of its 
superior processing power (240MHz dual-core), larger RAM (520KB), and multiple 
hardware peripherals needed for flight controller functions. The ESP8266 on 
the ground side handles the simpler task of receiving data and forwarding 
it to the computer.


C. Ground Control Software Design

The Ground Control Software is built as a web application that runs entirely 
in the browser. We chose this approach for several practical reasons.

First, a browser-based application works on any operating system - Windows, 
Mac, or Linux - without any changes to the code. This was helpful during 
development as team members used different laptops.

Second, there is no installation required. The user simply opens the HTML file 
in Chrome or Edge browser, and the application is ready to use. This is much 
simpler than creating an executable file that needs to be installed.

Third, modern browsers now support the Web Serial API, which allows JavaScript 
code to communicate directly with USB serial ports. This feature was introduced 
in Chrome version 89 (released in 2021). Using this API, our web application 
can read data from the ESP8266 without needing any server or additional software.

The software interface has the following main components:

1) Connection Panel: Shows whether the ESP8266 is connected or not, with a 
   button to establish the connection. Once connected, the status indicator 
   turns green.

2) Map Display: Uses the Leaflet.js library to show an interactive map with 
   satellite imagery. The current position of the UAV is shown as a marker 
   that updates in real-time as new GPS data is received.

3) Telemetry Dashboard: Displays the current values of latitude, longitude, 
   altitude, ground speed, heading direction, and number of GPS satellites. 
   These values update every 2 seconds when new data arrives.

4) System Log: Shows timestamped messages about connection status, data 
   reception, and any errors that occur. This helps in debugging when 
   something goes wrong.

The application is designed to work completely offline. Once the HTML file 
is loaded, no internet connection is needed for the core functionality 
(though the map tiles require internet to load the satellite imagery).


D. Data Communication

The communication between the ESP8266 and the browser uses a simple JSON-based 
protocol over USB serial. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) was chosen because 
it is easy to read during debugging, and JavaScript has built-in functions to 
parse JSON data.

When the ESP8266 receives a data packet from the nRF24L01+ module, it formats 
the information as a JSON object and sends it over the serial port. Each JSON 
message is sent on a new line, making it easy to separate individual messages.

A typical telemetry message contains the following fields:
- Type of message (telemetry)
- Latitude and longitude coordinates
- Altitude in meters
- Number of satellites being tracked
- Ground speed in km/h
- Heading direction in degrees
- Timestamp

The browser application reads the serial port continuously, parses each JSON 
message, and updates the display accordingly. If the JSON parsing fails (for 
example, if the data is corrupted), the error is logged but the application 
continues running.

The telemetry update rate is set to once every 2 seconds. This interval was 
chosen to balance between having reasonably current data and not overwhelming 
the serial communication. For a GPS-based tracking system, 2-second updates 
provide sufficient resolution to follow the UAV's movement on the map.


E. Initial Testing

Basic range testing was conducted with the RF communication link. The testing 
was performed in clear line-of-sight conditions, and the system demonstrated 
reliable data transmission. The telemetry data was received consistently at 
the ground station, and the map display updated correctly with the incoming 
GPS coordinates. Further extensive testing under various environmental 
conditions is planned as part of future work.
